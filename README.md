BIG DATA AND WEB INTELLIGENCE PROJECTS


Project description[Java, R, Python, Machine Learning, Databricks, Hadoop, MongoDB, MapReduce, Apache Pig, Apache Spark]

Analysis of Artist Listening Records:
● Analyzed the dataset on Last.FM which contains 92,800 artist listening records from 1892 users using MongoDB MapReduce operations.
● Wrote java program to connect to MongoDB and to answer key findings of the dataset.

Precipitation Data Analysis:
● Curated and analyzed the Hourly Precipitation Data (HPD) which is digital data set DSI-3240, archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).
● Processed data using Bitnami Hadoop which is set up on single node Hadoop cluster.
● Wrote Pig Latin scripts to answer key findings of the dataset like average highest precipitation, inch of precipitation, lowest precipitation in the following year, etc.

URL based Phishing Data Analysis:
● Used SparklyR's MLib, packages like C50, SparklyR, Rweka to perform the decision tree on the website phishing dataset which contains 1353 learning instances.
● Analyzed the training dataset using SparklyR to generate the unpruned and pruned decision tree.
● Calculated the classification accuracy of the learner on the training set.

H-1B Visa Petitions 2011 - 2016 dataset Analysis:
● Worked with Apache Spark on the cloud-based platform of Databricks to perform analysis on the H-1B Visa Petitions 2011 - 2016 dataset.
● Performed in-memory and on-disk processing to measure Spark's efficiency.
